1]How would you scale search to millions of listings?
Use Elasticsearch with Laravel Scout for full-text search.
 Index listings asynchronously via queues. Cache frequent searches with Redis.
  Shard data across regions.
   Paginate with cursor-based infinite scroll in Livewire.
2]How would you prevent spam and abuse?

To prevent spam I would add few protection layers.

First, email verification before user can send enquiry.
Then rate limit like number of enquiries per hour/day.

I would also block duplicate enquiries for same listing (already handled with unique constraint).

Captcha can be added on enquiry form to stop bots.

For content, basic keyword filtering + flag system can help detect abuse.

If platform grows, we can add trust score for users and stricter rules for new accounts


3]How would you design a moderation workflow?

Moderation should be status-driven and auditable.

I designed listings with statuses:

Draft

Pending Approval

Approved

Suspended

Workflow:

Provider creates or edits listing → Status = Pending

Admin reviews listing in moderation panel

Admin actions:

Approve → becomes visible in search

Reject → send feedback to provider

Suspend → hide due to policy violation

Enhancements I would add:

Moderation notes/history

Auto-flagging suspicious content

Bulk approval tools

Notification to providers on status change

This keeps public content controlled while allowing providers to iterating.

4]How would you prepare this system for multi-region support?

o support multiple countries / regions I will design database + infra both way.

Database side

Add country / region column in listings table.
City + suburb geo indexing for fast local search.
If data grows too big then partition data region wise.

Infrastructure

Deploy app servers in multiple regions (AWS / GCP).
Use load balancer + geo routing so user hit nearest server.
Use CDN for images / static files.

Search

Search should be region aware.
User should see nearby listings first not global.

Currency & localization

Add multi currency pricing support.
Timezone handling needed.
Language translation can be added later.

Data replication

Use read replicas per region.
Search indexes sync async (eventual consistency ok).

This way system will scale globally with low latency + better user experience
